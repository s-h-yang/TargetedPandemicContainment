# TargetedPandemicContainment

Code to reproduce results in "[Targeted Pandemic Containment Through Identifying Local Contact Network Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06939.pdf)".

The notebooks contain additional experiments for (i) different repreduction numbers R_0 = 1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5, (ii) delayed interventions, and (iii) comparison with eigenvector centrality.

To compute the local flow betweenness, see ```local_flow_betweenness.jl```.
